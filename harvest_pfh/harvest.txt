Edit the following as needed:

get ILS test segment start and stop times
  cat SQLLOGS/2021/06_Jun/{05..06}/??00/*.cmd | grep ILS_Spectral_Cal | more

browse tcr files for PFL, PFH, MN, Plateau number:
  more SQLLOGS/2021/06_Jun/{01..02}/??00/*.tcr

browse CCS data
  ls TEM_Collection/CCS/Collection/2021/06_Jun/{01..02}

notes 
 T1 > T2, for leg labels
 packets are 8 seconds long.
 legs are in time order below, test steps can vary
