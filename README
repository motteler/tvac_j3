CrIS J3 May-Jun 2021 TVAC gas cell tests and analysis
------------------------------------------------------

Note that the git repo does not include the mat files from the asl
version.  These would add around 24G, to much for github.  So you
can't run or rerun the tests from the repo.  The github version does
include all fig and png files for the reports.

Methods
--------
Work for a particular test is done first in the harvest and then in
the gas cell test directories, for example harvest_02-11 and then
02-12_mn_s1_CO.  The main harvest steps are listed in harvest.txt,
in each harvest directory.  Harvesting produces four CCSDS packet
files: ET1, ET2, FT1, and FT2.dat in the gas cell test directories.
These are translated to .mat files with source/dat2mat.m.  As a
precaution, running the first leg (or simply the whole script) twice
will guarantee an up-to date bit trim mask, in btrim_cache.mat.

The next step is to get an overview of the gas cell test data, by
running source/read.ccs.m.  This produces a summary plot for one day,
and saves a summary of the ccs data, for example ccs_data_02_12.mat.
Then edit and run plot_legs_LW, MW, and SW, using start and stop times
saved in harvest.txt, to see gas cell details of each test leg.  The
edited plot_legs scripts become the "offical" home for the gas cell
measurements.

spec_test1 plots count spectra as a function of frequency, and (for
a single channel) as a function of time.  This is used to trim the
harvesting to just the ES looks.  spec_test1 gives index limits used
by spec_test2 and fit run.  spec_test2 plots obs and calc together,
and fit run fits obs to calcs.

Directories
------------
reports        - final reports
source         - common source code
inst_data      - instrument data, mainly from ccast
mm-dd_*_s?_*   - tests by date, segment, side, and gas
harvest_mm-dd  - harvest notes and scripts, by date

Test Scripts
-------------
fit_run   - set up test params, call fit_tran, plot results

fit_plots - FOV breakouts and other plots, followup to fit_run

spec_test1 - quick look at gas cell count spectra with data from
    ccast/MITreader380b/read_cris_ccsds and ccast/source routines
    inst_params and igm2spec

spec_test2 - a basic comparison of observed and calculated gas cell
    transmittance, without any fitting, using ccast libs and kc2cris
    from the airs_decon package

Functions
----------
cmp_tran  - compare observed and calculated transmittances
fit_tran  - find wlaser deltas to match obs and calc
dat2mat   - call read_cris_ccsds on harvested data
read_ccs  - read and tabulate selected CCS fields
read_igm  - simple wrapper to read IGMs with the MIT reader
fit_info  - print fit_tran residuals and weights
fovcolors - 9 distinct colors for FOV plots
fovnames  -  FOV names for plot legend
